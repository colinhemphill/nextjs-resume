Most of my free time is spent creating music! I enjoy many elements of performance and production, and I play the guitar, piano, and drums. My professional training in audio engineering and my access to a well-equipped home studio leads to top quality audio and video production for music, podcasting, live streaming on Twitch, demo videos, and even Zoom video calls.

Additionally, I enjoy tabletop gaming, video games, travel, and podcasting. My wife and I host an anime podcast called The AniMonday Podcast.

On the side, I designed, created, and continue to maintain the following websites: [dotdotdarknessmusic.com](dotdotdarknessmusic.com), [animonday.moe](animonday.moe)
