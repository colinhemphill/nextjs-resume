At The Zebra, I create front end applications in React and TypeScript within the Simplicity objective. I am responsible for implementing designs, building new features, and making continual improvements to a number of experiences such as the funnel, quote comparisons, and user accounts. We focus on strict accessibility standards, performance, A/B testing, and maximizing conversions, while maintaining a user experience that makes the complex task of comparing insurance rates fast and simple. I am often responsible for managing tech initiatives, mentoring junior developers, and leading department initiatives like the Front End Friends meetings.
