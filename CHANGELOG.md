## [3.5.0] - 2023-04-07

### Added

- `resumeConfig.appTheme` property
  - If set to `ThemeSetting.System`, Tailwind will use `media` mode to set the color theme
  - If set to `ThemeSetting.Light` or `ThemeSetting.Dark`, Tailwind will use the `class` mode to set the color scheme
  - The app layout applies the `dark` class if `resumeConfig.appTheme` is set to `ThemeSetting.Dark`
- `resumeConfig.pdfTheme` property
  - Will set the color theme only for a generated PDF
  - Can be set independently of the app theme
  - Defaults to `Theme.Light` for printing purposes

### Changed

- All PDF icons use the color helper functions

## [3.4.0] - 2023-04-07

### Added

- Helper functions for getting Radix colors based on a requested shade and your `resumeConfig` settings
- Generate app icons using the new [image generation](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/optimizing/image-generation) and [file-based metadata](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/metadata#file-based-metadata) features
- Add a file-based metadata route for generating a sitemap

### Changed

- Dependency upgrades, including [Next.js 13.3](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-3)
- The `ogImageTheme` setting in `resumeConfig.ts` is now called `imageTheme` since it also applies to icon generation
  - It also uses a `Theme` enum instead of a plain string now
- Minor styling adjustments

### Removed

- All manually created static images used for icons and favicons

## [3.3.1] - 2023-04-06

### Changed

- Migrated the OG generator from `/pages/api/og.tsx` to a route handler at `/app/api/og/route.tsx`
  - This is a non-breaking change from the perspective of using the API, but if you've already modified your OG generator to customize the styles or content, you'll want to make those changes in the route handler now

## [3.3.0] - 2023-04-06

### Added

- Styles for inline `code` blocks

### Changed

- Dependency upgrades
- Rewrote Tailwind config in TypeScript (a [Tailwind 3.3 feature](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3-3))
- Use [windy-radix-palette](https://github.com/brattonross/windy-radix-palette) to manage colors, with a few personal touches
  - Supports automatic dark mode, so I was able to remove most `dark:` prefixes
  - Supports semantic color names so I am able to keep the `neutral` and `accent` conventions
  - Adds an `accentContrast` color name to determine the appropriate contrasting color for configured accent color (Radix "bright" colors like "sky" and "mint" require black foreground text)
- `resumeConfig` is now a TypeScript file
- `resumeConfig` now uses enums for the `accentColor` and `neutralColor` properties
  - e.g. `accentColor: AccentColors.Blue`
- Swap "Roboto Mono" for "JetBrains Mono" as the default monospace font

### Removed

- Tailwind Typography plugin and `prose` classes
  - Now uses a few custom styles that are easier to control and match to the rest of the document

## [3.1.0] - 2023-02-22

### Added

  - Adjust font sizes accordingly

- Switch to rendering SVG components for PDF icons instead of raster images
